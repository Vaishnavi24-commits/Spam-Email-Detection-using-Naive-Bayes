# Spam-Email-Detection-using-Naive-Bayes
Developed a machine learning model to classify emails as spam or ham (not spam) using the Naive Bayes algorithm. The dataset was preprocessed by cleaning and encoding, and CountVectorizer was used to transform text data into numerical features. The model was trained using an 80-20 train-test split and achieved solid performance.
